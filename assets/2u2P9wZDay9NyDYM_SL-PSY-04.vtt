00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.930
<v ->How many times have you presented something</v>

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.710
to your potential customers,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.830
and notice them fidgeting or glancing

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.810
around at everything in the room but your presentation.

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.070
You could probably tell what they were thinking,

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.370
that they're bored or restless,

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.200
not by listening to their words,

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.050
but by picking up on their nonverbal cues.

9
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.970
In sales, the ability to read body language

10
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.880
is just as important as your listening skills.

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.873
Much human communication happens without words.

12
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.760
So how can you read body language in a sales meeting?

13
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.500
The eyes reveal a lot about a potential customer's interest

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.330
or level of engagement.

15
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.080
When we're engaged, we hold our gaze longer

16
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.760
on the object of interest.

17
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.270
We might return our eyes repeatedly to that focal point.

18
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.140
But when we're not engaged, we keep looking away,

19
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.550
searching for a distraction.

20
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.030
Without saying a word,

21
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.620
our mouths can also betray our true feelings.

22
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.470
Tightened lips could be a sign of worry or disapproval.

23
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620
A slight curve upwards on the lips

24
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.500
could indicate agreement or pleasure.

25
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.533
Next, watch a perspective buyers hands.

26
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.360
For instance, are they tapping their fingers on the table?

27
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.310
They could be impatient.

28
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.080
Are their fingers interlaced?

29
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.653
That might signal concern.

30
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.950
Another way to gauge interest is by watching the upper body.

31
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.610
When something piques our interest,

32
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.570
we naturally lean forward.

33
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.230
But if we're feeling dismissive,

34
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.720
we might turn our shoulders

35
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.570
instead of fully facing the other person.

36
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.300
Finally, our lower body can indicate

37
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.810
similar engagement or lack of it.

38
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.030
We tend to stretch our legs forward when we're interested,

39
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.350
but if we're bored or irritated, we might tuck our legs

40
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.393
under the chair.

41
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.460
Reading someone's body language is a good way

42
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.420
to spot tension in a room.

43
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.450
By catching these problems early,

44
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.720
you can create more opportunities to engage in conversation

45
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.680
and handle objections, but communication goes two ways.

46
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.280
So what can you do to make sure you're sending

47
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.883
the right message to your potential buyers?

48
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.410
Let's look at five tips for using body language in sales.

49
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.650
First, open your arms.

50
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.760
A wide open stance makes you more approachable.

51
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.060
When you cross your arms or hide your hands

52
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.290
behind your back, you appear more aloof.

53
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.200
Second, make just enough eye contact.

54
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.360
Too little and it can seem like you're not engaged,

55
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.470
but hold that contact for too long,

56
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.430
over five seconds, and it can make others uncomfortable.

57
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.310
Next, bridge the gap.

58
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.710
Physical proximity speaks volumes.

59
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.823
The closer we get to someone, the more we can bond.

60
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.950
In a professional context,

61
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.600
it can be uncomfortable to get too close.

62
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.200
So respect that personal space of about four feet,

63
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.010
but try not to stand all the way

64
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.590
on the other side of the room,

65
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.173
while you're trying to form a personal connection.

66
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.630
Next, use your hands.

67
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.950
Salespeople who use hand gestures

68
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.990
keep audiences more engaged

69
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.880
than those who remain still and unmoving.

70
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.100
Movement makes whatever you're saying more dynamic.

71
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.470
And finally, nod and smile often.

72
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.870
When we nod along to what someone is saying,

73
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.320
we encourage that person to keep speaking

74
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.300
and communicate that we're listening attentively.

75
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.493
Smiling also helps to put the other person at ease.

76
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.040
Thinking about all these details

77
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.480
might feel overwhelming at first,

78
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.970
but with practice, you'll soon learn to see

79
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.940
what people are sharing without using words.

80
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.530
Body language dominates communication.

81
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.660
Salespeople who listen with their eyes

82
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.913
and ears will truly connect with customers.
