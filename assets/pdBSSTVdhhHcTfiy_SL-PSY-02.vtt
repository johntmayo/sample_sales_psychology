00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.000
<v ->Have you ever wondered how your extroverted coworker,</v>

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.570
can spend so much time around people without getting tired?

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.800
They're always showing up to happy hours,

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.220
networking events and conferences.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.950
They can strike up a conversation

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.490
with just about anyone, and it doesn't seem like

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.800
they have trouble finding prospects.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.260
As an introvert, you don't always enjoy talking to people

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.930
at least not for prolonged periods.

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.760
You like to relax by yourself.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.320
And it doesn't bother you too much

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.530
when you can't attend an event,

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.780
you might even relish the chance to be alone.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.030
That's because introverts direct their energy inward,

15
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.700
spending time alone, reflecting on their thoughts

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.110
and processing their feelings, refreshes introverts.

17
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.100
On the other hand,

18
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490
extroverts direct their energy outward.

19
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.910
Contact with others charges them up

20
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.303
and gets them ready to go.

21
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.730
Sales might feel like the perfect fit

22
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.680
for those who enjoy stimulating environments.

23
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.440
But quality is more associated with introversion,

24
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.700
can also help you thrive and succeed in the long run.

25
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.133
Let's look at some of those hidden advantages.

26
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.320
Here are five introvert qualities that are great for sales.

27
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.800
Of course, some extroverts might also possess these traits,

28
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.740
but they may come more naturally to introverts.

29
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.820
Introverts tend to be good listeners,

30
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.510
and listening is a critical skill in sales.

31
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.050
Because understanding what a customer needs

32
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.830
can help you find the best solution for them.

33
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.480
Because they're not focused on making small talk,

34
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.650
introverts don't waste time.

35
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.080
They get the work done

36
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.193
and may even close deals faster.

37
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.300
Of course, this doesn't mean that extroverts waste time.

38
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.910
Making small talk has its own value

39
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.080
but introverts can redirect their energy

40
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.170
into other tasks, such as following up on leads,

41
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.720
organizing the pipeline

42
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.733
or thinking of ways to make their process more efficient.

43
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.500
Another introvert quality advantageous in sales,

44
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.960
is that introverts like to prepare.

45
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.400
Introverted salespeople are good at researching and planning

46
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.360
which gives them an edge in important meetings.

47
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.550
Next, introverts excel at critical thinking.

48
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.780
They tend to spend a lot of time analyzing processes

49
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.920
to see what they can do better.

50
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.180
Finally, introverts communicate well in writing.

51
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.350
Writing gives them more time to think about

52
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.643
what they want to say.

53
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.930
So, it turns out that introverts have top notch qualities

54
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.340
to bring to sales.

55
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.920
But how can you keep thriving,

56
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.270
through all the people facing activities

57
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.173
that come with being a salesperson?

58
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's look at some tips

59
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.020
on how to succeed in sales as an introvert.

60
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.270
First, play to your strengths.

61
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.000
Remember, a lot of sales activities can be performed alone

62
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.600
like reaching out and following up with email,

63
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.040
researching prospects, preparing sales presentations,

64
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.470
and analyzing processes.

65
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.260
Second, don't try to be extrovert.

66
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.470
Don't like interacting in big groups,

67
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.760
focus instead on building one-on-one rapport with customers.

68
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.860
Your job is to help customers find what they need

69
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.860
not talk their ear off.

70
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.450
Third, ask open-ended questions.

71
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.550
Find out what customers are thinking

72
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.313
by letting them do the talking.

73
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.070
For example, you might ask

74
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.810
what are some concerns you have about the product?

75
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.920
Can you tell me a little bit about your experience

76
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.853
with the service.

77
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.420
Next, avoid overthinking.

78
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.710
One trap introverted salespeople can fall into

79
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.500
is to overthink and block progress.

80
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.410
To prevent this, stop and ask yourself

81
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.850
am I too anxious?

82
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.750
Is this stopping me from doing work?

83
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.670
Finally, take the time to recharge.

84
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.000
Introverts gain energy from spending time alone.

85
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.150
So it's important to schedule some solitary pursuits

86
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.223
after a day of meetings and calls.

87
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.060
There's no innate quality you need to succeed in sales.

88
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.920
Both introverts and extroverts possess unique strengths.

89
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.270
If you're an introvert,

90
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.120
you can focus on the skills that come easily to you,

91
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.140
to improve your processes and relationships

92
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.480
at the same time acknowledge areas you can work on

93
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.830
and don't beat yourself up,

94
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.230
for not having qualities that come naturally to extroverts.

95
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.003
There's no one right way, to be a sales person.
