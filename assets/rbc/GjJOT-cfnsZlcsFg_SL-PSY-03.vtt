00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.970
<v ->You're holding your breath</v>

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.710
as you await your prospect's next words.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.610
After months of back and forth,

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.140
you're finally going to close that sale,

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.700
but what comes next hits you like a blow to the head.

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.170
They're not moving forward on the deal.

7
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.980
Your mind races as you ask yourself,

8
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.340
how could this happen?

9
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.930
After all that time I spent talking with them, why?

10
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.990
Did I do something wrong?

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.980
Rejection like this is a natural part of the sales process,

12
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.160
but just because it's normal doesn't mean it's easy,

13
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.690
especially when you're just starting out.

14
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.003
So why is sales rejection so hard to take?

15
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.420
Our body responds to rejection

16
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.640
in much the same way it does to physical pain.

17
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.740
This reaction also reduces our capacity to reason,

18
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.130
decreases self-control and elevates levels of aggression.

19
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.460
Beyond this physiological response,

20
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.970
other factors also make rejection hard to take.

21
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.990
Here are three reasons that coping with rejection

22
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.540
can be difficult.

23
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.880
The first is sunk cost.

24
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.890
Sunk costs are the time or resources you've spent

25
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.023
on something and can't recover if it falls through.

26
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.020
Salespeople often invest a lot of time with a prospect

27
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.800
to answer their questions, demonstrate products

28
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.610
and research their needs,

29
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.320
so when those efforts don't pay off,

30
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.573
you might feel like you've wasted your time.

31
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.720
Another issue is the fear of failure.

32
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.990
Maybe your manager set an aggressive quota for the quarter

33
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.520
and you're stressed about it,

34
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.430
or sometimes, you might equate a sales rejection

35
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.040
with personal failure.

36
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.360
These added pressures can make it difficult

37
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940
to deal with rejection.

38
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.170
And finally,

39
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.040
salespeople often develop personal relationships

40
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.230
with prospects.

41
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.300
You may build great rapport and even friendships.

42
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.610
That can make it tough

43
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.593
not to take rejection personally.

44
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.540
Knowing that sales rejection is common and inevitable,

45
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.140
what are some coping strategies

46
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.290
to help you get through those moments?

47
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.530
Let's take a look at five mindsets you can adopt

48
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.493
to face rejection head on.

49
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.400
First, remember that every no gets you closer to a yes.

50
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.230
See how many no's proceed that first yes.

51
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.470
Do the math, if it helps, and ask yourself,

52
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.890
if I reach out to 100 prospects,

53
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.850
how many of them can I expect to say yes?

54
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.150
Out of those people,

55
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.970
how many can I expect to move farther along the pipeline?

56
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.210
Approximately how many people end up buying

57
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.200
from that initial pool?

58
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.270
Next, understand that no doesn't mean never.

59
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.200
Getting rejected might feel like the end of the road,

60
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.950
but it doesn't have to be.

61
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.020
You can always build on the relationship

62
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.220
to move things forward in the future

63
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.470
or even ask for referrals now.

64
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.330
The third mindset to adopt

65
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.440
is that a rejection equals a relationship.

66
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.883
Let's look at what that means in practice.

67
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.370
Think about it.

68
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.420
If you never reach out, you can't get rejected.

69
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.250
So when someone says no,

70
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.540
they've at least taken the time to listen.

71
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.080
Even though it wasn't the response you wanted,

72
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.880
you now have an opportunity to cultivate a relationship.

73
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.680
This isn't about being pushy or aggressive.

74
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.210
Instead, take the chance to make a good impression.

75
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.510
Thank the person politely, ask for feedback,

76
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.490
and when appropriate, invite them to recommend others

77
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.053
who might benefit from your product or service.

78
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.690
Next, effort matters.

79
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.520
In a fast-paced sales environment with one goal,

80
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.630
closing the deal, this one can feel tricky,

81
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.500
but remember, stressing out is exhausting

82
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.400
and counterproductive.

83
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.620
When rejections happen, you know you're putting in the work

84
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.640
to get closer to the goal.

85
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.380
Finally, keep things in perspective.

86
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.350
The best salespeople will tell you

87
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.500
not to sweat a single rejection,

88
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.460
especially because you'll experience more rejection

89
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.380
the longer you're in the game.

90
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.673
Learn from the experience and move on.

91
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.460
We all face rejection sometimes,

92
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.130
and in sales, regular rejection is part of the job.

93
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.390
Adopt a healthy mindset for dealing with sales rejection

94
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.403
to stay positive, motivated, and primed for success.
