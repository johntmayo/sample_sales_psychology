00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.580
<v ->Imagine, you walk into a store looking for a new laptop.</v>

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.510
The salesperson approaches to show you the latest model

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.110
with all the best features,

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.830
but he's not talking about the features you care about.

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.630
So, you turn him down and you walk out of the store.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.730
When we don't understand why someone wants to buy,

7
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.170
we can easily miss out on a sale.

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.220
But uncover the buyer's motivation,

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.030
and we can instantly boost our sales.

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.373
So, let's look at some reasons that people buy.

11
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.810
The fear of missing out, also known as FOMO,

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.610
drives many purchases.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.160
If your local grocery store is running low

14
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.720
on your favorite brand of pasta, you may grab it,

15
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.210
even though you walked in to buy milk.

16
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.910
Instant gratification can make people spend more than usual.

17
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.710
When you want something right away,

18
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.990
you don't mind paying a premium.

19
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.080
The bandwagon effect describes our tendency

20
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.540
to go with the crowd.

21
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.710
That crowd could be online reviewers,

22
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.600
close friends and acquaintances, or public figures.

23
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.320
Reciprocity can be a powerful agent behind a purchase.

24
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320
When you do something nice for someone,

25
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.570
they'll return the favor.

26
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.830
This works even in a sales context.

27
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.490
Imagine it's Saturday night,

28
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.650
and you're in the mood for some sushi.

29
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.430
There are two sushi restaurants in your neighborhood,

30
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.610
both at a similar price point.

31
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.650
But the last time you went to the first,

32
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.970
the server brought you a delicious complimentary dish.

33
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.523
This generous act might sway your decision.

34
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.750
Consistency is about aligning our ideas

35
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.280
about who we are with what we buy.

36
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.340
If you're an eco-conscious person,

37
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.210
you might want to support eco-friendly brands.

38
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.900
Sometimes simplicity is best.

39
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.100
A hundred ice cream flavors might sound cool in theory,

40
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.840
but how are you going to decide?

41
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260
Maybe it's best to go with vanilla.

42
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.920
Nostalgia often applies

43
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.200
to buying things we don't really need,

44
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.270
but make us remember good times,

45
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.220
like an action figure from your favorite childhood cartoon.

46
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.490
So, what do these factors mean for you as a salesperson?

47
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.840
Let's see how you can apply those motivations

48
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.060
to make a sale with an example.

49
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.130
Imagine you're the salesperson talking

50
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.223
to a customer at the computer store.

51
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.040
The first thing you'll want to do is find out

52
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.170
why the customer wants a laptop.

53
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.540
What's their motivation?

54
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.380
Ask questions like, why are you looking for a new laptop?

55
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.900
What features do you need in a laptop?

56
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.460
How do you use your laptop day to day?

57
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.490
When the customer answers, listen closely.

58
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.900
Maybe they said they want to play games,

59
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.040
but their laptop keeps freezing.

60
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.250
Based on that, you can guess that their current laptop

61
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.520
probably isn't built to handle gaming,

62
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.460
and that they'll want a new machine that is.

63
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.100
At this stage, don't jump to the best model on the market.

64
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.390
Instead, simplify the choice

65
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.693
by offering a good range of options.

66
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.820
Here's an example of what you might say.

67
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.380
X is good for less intensive games and it's affordable.

68
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.320
You can handle most games well for a bit more money.

69
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.980
And Z is the best on the market for gaming.

70
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.653
It's also the most expensive.

71
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.240
Next, you can offer some credibility

72
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.350
by telling the customer that X, Y and Z are very popular

73
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.680
among customers who are into gaming.

74
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.760
You could also mention a famous gamer

75
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.630
who uses those laptops if you know of one.

76
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.900
So, what else can you do to lock in the sale?

77
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.230
Create a sense of scarcity by making factual statements

78
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.290
about the popularity of the models you are suggesting,

79
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.370
or by mentioning any limited time discounts and deals,

80
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.180
then make a special offer if you have one available.

81
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.470
Does your store include a free headset

82
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.620
with the purchase of a certain computer?

83
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.500
Is the laptop cheaper with the purchase of an accessory?

84
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.900
Finally, remind the customer of their motivation.

85
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.830
You might tell them they don't need to worry

86
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.260
about the laptop freezing because it's built

87
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.300
to handle the types of games they like to play.

88
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.700
This also helps them imagine playing games

89
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.020
on their new machine.

90
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.763
The next thing you know, you've made a sale.

91
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.440
People buy for many different reasons

92
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.250
beyond price and quality,

93
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.310
including a fear of missing out,

94
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.020
instant gratification, simplicity, and nostalgia.

95
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.940
Your job as a salesperson is to find out

96
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.090
why someone might be interested in what you're selling.

97
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.830
Then, you can use the different motivations

98
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.730
to speak to their interests.

99
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.770
Not only will that help that person find

100
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.490
exactly what they need, but it can also boost your sales

101
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.163
and improve your performance.
