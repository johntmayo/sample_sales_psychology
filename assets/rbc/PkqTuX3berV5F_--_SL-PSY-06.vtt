00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.190
<v ->Have you ever felt like you spent all day working</v>

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.960
yet accomplished nothing?

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.860
Maybe you were so busy you didn't even have time to eat

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.400
and were running on caffeine and sugar.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.510
Unfortunately, a lot of salespeople feel under pressure

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.040
like this every day.

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.300
They're so stressed that

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.200
they don't take proper care of themselves,

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.763
and over time this can lead to burnout.

10
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.630
So what makes sales a high stress environment?

11
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.930
Let's look at 7 causes of stress in sales.

12
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.710
First, sales is a competition.

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.830
Second, it's frontline work.

14
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.950
You need to represent more than yourself.

15
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.260
Third, it's time-sensitive.

16
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.420
The clock's always ticking until the end of the week,

17
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.910
month, quarter, or year.

18
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.680
Next, sales deals with numbers.

19
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.110
Things that go unmeasured may not count as progress or wins.

20
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.170
And sales is all about talking to people.

21
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.530
Interacting with strangers every day isn't easy.

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.550
Sales is also full of rejection that you can't avoid.

23
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.180
Finally, you may face unrealistic expectations

24
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.683
that make you feel like you're never doing enough.

25
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.040
Clearly, salespeople have valid reasons for feeling stress.

26
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.220
So acknowledge your feelings

27
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.163
and then learn healthy ways to cope.

28
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.870
But what are some of those coping mechanisms?

29
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.370
How can you get stress under control and prevent burnout?

30
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.240
Here are five remedies for salespeople.

31
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.050
Start by identifying the type of stress.

32
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.440
Know how you're being affected so that you can address it.

33
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.130
In many cases, stress is rooted in fear of failure.

34
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.010
You might be worried that you won't meet your sales quota

35
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.140
or that you'll choke and torpedo a big deal.

36
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.600
Your stress may also stem from feeling overwhelmed.

37
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.900
You have too many calls to make or pitches to prepare.

38
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.790
You can't seem to clear your schedule,

39
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.280
even when you're working overtime.

40
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.110
Imposter syndrome, where you feel like a fraud,

41
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.180
is common across professions and sales is no exception.

42
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.750
No matter how well you do,

43
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.023
you always question your accomplishments.

44
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.260
Once you've identified the source of your stress

45
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.200
you can address the root cause.

46
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.910
Do you fear failure? Learn to expect and embrace it.

47
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.220
Feeling overwhelmed? Take a break.

48
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.310
And examine your processes to see

49
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.390
where you can increase your focus.

50
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.390
Do you feel like an imposter?

51
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.410
Know that you aren't the only one

52
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.683
and start celebrating the small victories.

53
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.500
The next remedy is to detach yourself from outcomes.

54
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.000
Put some distance between your self-worth

55
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.600
and your sales success.

56
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.050
Think of other ways to build value in your life.

57
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.800
Next, don't compare yourself to others.

58
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.020
Forget about what others are doing and focus on yourself.

59
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.010
That's the only comparison that matters.

60
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.960
Also be more selective with your energy.

61
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.790
Practice picking one thing to do

62
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.970
for the next hour and the next, and then the next.

63
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.270
Finally, consider the building blocks

64
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.610
of your physical health: nutrition, movement, and sleep.

65
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.840
Be realistic.

66
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.860
If 10 minutes of exercise is all you can do, that's fine.

67
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.300
Keep water on your desk to stay hydrated

68
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.980
and when you're done with work, leave.

69
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.753
Give yourself time for relaxation and a good night's sleep.

70
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.670
We can't always avoid stress in sales,

71
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.590
it's baked into the profession.

72
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.710
But we can learn to manage it.

73
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.690
If you take care of yourself first,

74
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.483
success in sales will follow.
