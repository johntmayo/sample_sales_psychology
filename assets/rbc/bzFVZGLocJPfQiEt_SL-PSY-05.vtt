00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.260
<v ->Remember the last time you talked to a sales person</v>

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.370
at a store?

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.650
Did you feel annoyed by their approach

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.650
or did you appreciate their help?

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.010
Think about why you felt that way.

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.150
What did the sales person do to either,

7
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.000
get on your nerves or gain your trust?

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.570
Personality types can come into play in many situations.

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.080
In sales, they can reveal how people prefer to interact

10
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.400
and make decisions.

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.490
Knowing how to approach each type

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.693
can facilitate those interactions and boost your sales.

13
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.110
There are four types of buyer personalities.

14
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.700
Now these are broad generalizations

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.340
but they can help you understand

16
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.060
some of the different ways buyers behave.

17
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.470
First amiable buyers are friendly and easy to approach.

18
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.890
You can usually spot them by their relaxed demeanor,

19
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.840
they're patient and non-confrontational.

20
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.060
Animated personalities also like to be social.

21
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.360
But while those with amiable characteristics are relaxed,

22
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.470
animated types are full of energy

23
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.200
and tend to prefer a faster pace.

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.240
Analytical buyers need all the details before they buy.

25
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.160
They might even know as much about your product

26
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.580
or service as you do,

27
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.120
because of the research they've done.

28
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.720
And assertive buyers speak their mind,

29
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.840
and don't like to waste time.

30
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.620
When a buyer just wants to get down to business,

31
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.693
they're probably an assertive type.

32
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.180
Considering the differences between these four types,

33
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.400
what are some ways you can use to approach each one?

34
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.180
Let's start with the two styles

35
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.033
that prefer to stay more social.

36
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.980
With an amiable personality, it's important to take it easy,

37
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.070
relax your posture when you speak to them

38
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.080
and focus on group benefits.

39
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360
Whatever you do, don't rush them.

40
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.380
Buyers of this type, take the longest to decide

41
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.610
because they like to consider how their choices

42
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.400
will affect others.

43
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.680
Animated buyers are easy to spot

44
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.580
because they're the most talkative and engaging.

45
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.540
Tell a story to get their attention

46
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.320
and get to know them by asking personal questions

47
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.750
to win their trust.

48
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.560
Always follow up with the details

49
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.483
because an animated buyer may get distracted.

50
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.400
Next, we'll talk about the two styles

51
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.010
that like to focus on the task at hand.

52
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.450
These styles don't need a lot of small talk

53
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.303
and would rather just get the information they need.

54
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.400
When you come across an analytical personality

55
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.610
remember to be prepared, don't use opinions

56
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.780
and be sure to enlist experts.

57
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.870
These buyers don't care about rave reviews from you

58
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.910
or other ordinary customers, they need to see the evidence.

59
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.840
Clarity is the most important quality for assertive types.

60
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.650
So cut to the chase and give them the best recommendations.

61
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.470
And don't be shy, confidence is the key

62
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.373
to convincing an assertive buyer.

63
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.530
When it comes to buyer personalities, knowledge is power.

64
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.340
Once you identify which style of customer your speaking to,

65
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.100
you can adopt different strategies

66
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.870
to put that person at ease, rather than aggravate them.

67
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.200
Also after discovering your preferred style,

68
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.140
you can practice mirroring the style

69
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.200
that is the most challenging for you to interact with.

70
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.610
In time, shifting your approaches

71
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.000
so you can sell effectively to different personality types

72
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.453
will become second nature.
